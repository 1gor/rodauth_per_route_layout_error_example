#+TITLE: Demo app to replicate error when trying layout per route in Rodauth.

* Description

With reference to news group thread https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rodauth/MOBVSp2z-Qg

The code to trigger the error is at the end of =./config/rodauth_config.rb= file.

This demo app uses =fast_gettext= gem for translations, which makes it necessary to implement a lot of 'custom features' for =rodauth=, mainly to replace hard-coded strings in rodauth templates with translated strings.
